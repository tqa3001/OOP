# OOP Pillars
1. Encapsulation: Data and functions that operate on those data should be put together in a class -> I want data
  to be access only in predictable ways through public methods. In short, Encapsulation ~ Data hiding.

# Design patterns
1. Strategy
The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms into separate classes called strategies.

2. Builder
The Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders.
- Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.
