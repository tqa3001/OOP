# Why UML? 
- Visualize the system -> Catch design flaws -> Better software
- Faster coding (most of the mental overhead are transferred to the UML diagram drawing phase)

# Common types of UML (not all)
- Behavorial
  1. Action: columns for actors, rows for timeline.
  2. Use case diagrams: bipartite graph (stakeholders, usages + relationship between usages)
- Structural 
  1. **Class diagram**: 
    Class: name on top, attributes middle, methods bottom, +(public)/-(private)/#(protected)//(derived)
  2. Object diagram: For instances of classes.
  3. Component diagram: Docker but on paper.
